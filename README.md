# cha_cha_20_image_encrypt_and_decrypt

In recent years, advancements in cryptographic algorithms have spurred innovative approaches to secure image encryption. 
Our paper presents a unique image encryption methodology, emphasizing the ChaCha20 algorithm for secure image transfer. 
By integrating transformation matrices for image shuffling and ChaCha20 encryption, our method enhances image security. 
The process involves four steps: first, shuffling the image with a transformation matrix; next, encrypting it with ChaCha20 for security; then, decrypting it to recover the image; finally, restoring the original image using an inverse transformation matrix. This preserves integrity while safeguarding image privacy. 
The employed transformation matrix ensures reversible scrambling, while ChaCha20 encryption provides robust security against cyber threats. 
We achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 361.20199909921956 and an MSE (mean squared error) of 0.0, indicating high-quality reconstructed images. 
Additionally, our study introduces an extra security layer, fortifying images against potential cyber threats. 
Through encryption and decryption phases, our method ensures data security, integrity, and quality preservation, addressing contemporary encryption needs. 
This research advances data security and encryption methodologies, providing a robust solution for securely transmitting and storing images. 
The results highlight ChaCha20's superiority in offering reliable, efficient, and high-fidelity encryptionâ€”a crucial feature in today's digital landscape where data protection is paramount.
